# Perfect-Numbers
A very poorly written script involving perfect numbers to help me learn more about Python.

This is a Python 3 script. There are two arguments when you use it:
Argument 1 is either "iterate" or "check". Argument 2 is any number you'd like to check.
"iterate" will cause the script to check every number up to (and including) the number you choose. "check" simply checks the number.
Obviously, using "check" is quicker, but this program was written in python, so if you're worried about speed look literally anywhere else. 
Iterating 0 or 1 will result in nothing. Check will simply say that they are not perfect.
I made this whole thing a function because I intend to import it for future projects.


###So what is a perfect number?
A perfect number is any number that, if you add up all of its factors, equals the same number. 6 is a good example.
The factors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3 (technically, 6 is a factor as well, but for these purposes it is not counted). So, adding 1 + 2 + 3 will give you 6. Pretty neat!

As a side note, I have no idea what the syntax is for this readme, so sorry about the weird formatting.
