# Perfect-Numbers
A very poorly written script involving perfect numbers to help me learn more about Python.

This is a Python 3 script. There are two arguments when you use it:
Argument 1 is either "iterate" or "check". Argument 2 is any number you'd like to check.
"iterate" will cause the script to check every number up to (and including) the number you choose. "check" simply checks the number.
Obviously, using "check" is quicker, but this program was written in python, so if you're worried about speed look literally anywhere else.
